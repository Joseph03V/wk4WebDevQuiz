# My WebDev Portfolio

## Functionality
This is a quiz game to help web developers test their knowledge. Every time they get an answer wrong the timer decriments by 15 seconds. Which makes it challenging. Also a challenge to beat other high scores. The quiz is supposed to save your highscore and allow you to clear the scores. This is an unfinished project so i was unable to add these features. As well as get the quiz to show multiple questions or allow answers. 
(this was a very hard project)

## Improvements
Improvements I could make is definitely meeting the acceptance critera lol. There was alot I was unable to do. 
Once the basic acceptance criteria is finished, I would like to add a feature that lets you look at a leaderboard of online players and their scores. I could also add a section where users give question suggestions. I could make it to where the user could customize their quiz and set how many questions.

## Challenges I faced
I struggled IMMENSLY on the javascript portion of this project. I feel like I know exactly what javascript things do what, and I know how to use everything I've learned, but I just don't know how to connect them. How to make them all connect into this big project. So I know how to seperatly make functions but when it comes to making them link to each other i'm lost.

## What did I learn
I had a lot of practice on javascript. Didn't learn alot though.
